"""Stage 6b — independent cross-model validation.

Stage 6 checks that each claim's supporting quote actually appears in the
article. That catches invented quotes, but not a claim that misreads a real
quote — the span is genuine, the inference from it is wrong.

Catching that needs a second opinion, and specifically a second opinion from
a DIFFERENT model than the one that wrote the summary. A model asked to
grade its own work agrees with itself.

The judge runs on the cheapest high-quota tier available (Gemma allows
14,400 requests a day against the ~5 this pipeline uses), so the check is
effectively free. It only sees items that are actually going to be published
— judging the tail would be spending calls on cards nobody reads.

A judge verdict never silently rewrites a summary. It can only:
  * mark an item disputed, which shows on the card, or
  * reject it, which keeps it off the site and logs why.
