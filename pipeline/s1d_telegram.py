"""Stage 1d — public Telegram channels.

Telegram exposes a read-only web preview of any PUBLIC channel at
``t.me/s/<name>``. No bot, no token, no API key, no account — verified
against several channels before this was written. Private channels have no
such preview and would need a bot added to them; that is not supported here.

Channels are a genuinely different source class from RSS. A CTI channel
posts a link plus a line of context within minutes of something breaking,
often well before anyone writes an article about it. What they do not give
is article text, so most items arrive as a headline and a URL — stage 3
fetches the real body from the link.

Many channels post through link shorteners (ift.tt, bit.ly, buff.ly).
Those are resolved here, because an unresolved shortener breaks three things
at once: source tiering, de-duplication, and the reference link a reader
clicks.
